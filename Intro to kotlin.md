# Introduction to Kotlin

## What is Kotlin?
Kotlin is a modern, trending programming language that was released in 2016 by JetBrains.
It has become very popular since it is compatible with Java (one of the most popular programming languages out there), which means that Java code (and libraries) can be used in Kotlin programs.

## Kotlin is used for:
- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Web development
- Server side applications
- Data science
- And much, much more!

## Why Use Kotlin?
- Kotlin is fully compatible with Java
- Kotlin works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, - - Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Kotlin is concise and safe
- Kotlin is easy to learn, especially if you already know Java
- Kotlin is free to use.

## Fundamentals of kotlin:
Kotlin is a statically-typed, cross-platform programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine. Some of the fundamental concepts of Kotlin include:

- Null Safety: Kotlin has null safety features that prevent null references from causing the app to crash, making it safer and more reliable than Java.

- Function and Lambda Expressions: Kotlin supports function and lambda expressions, allowing developers to write more concise and readable code.

- Interoperability with Java: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning that existing Java code can be easily integrated with Kotlin code and vice versa.

- Object-Oriented Programming: Kotlin supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- Extension Functions: Kotlin allows developers to extend existing classes with new functionality, without having to inherit from them, using extension functions.

- Type Inference: Kotlin has a strong type inference system, allowing the compiler to deduce the type of a variable or expression based on the context, reducing the amount of code required.

- Coroutines: Kotlin has a built-in support for coroutines, a lightweight concurrency model that can make asynchronous programming easier and more efficient.
